						<strong>We work around your schedule</strong> – our staff will always make themselves available at the time that works best for you<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>We identify properties based on your criteria</strong> – you receive a portfolio of relevant investment property opportunities, only after we:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Conduct an analysis that ensures the local market demonstrates high employment, a sustainable economy, and a strong rental culture
							</li>
							<li>
								Identify top neighborhoods by investigating for such factors as household income as well as quality of schools, hospitals, and other elements that make a neighborhood desirable
							</li>
							<li>
								Select the best opportunities for SFR investment by presenting you those that provide the best cap rates (the ratio between the net operating income produced by an asset and its capital cost)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>We show you comp data</strong> – you will see the sales prices and rental rates of comparable properties to those in our SFR investment portfolio, helping you better understand each opportunity’s earning potential—whether that home is across town, or on the other side of the country
						<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>We take care of the details</strong> – our real estate agents handle the entire acquisition process, including: 
					   	<ul>
					   		<li>
					   			Managing appraisals and inspections so that they are completed promptly and accurately
					   		</li>
					   		<li>
					   			Procuring insurance that is cost-effective and protects you and your investment
					   		</li>
					   		<li>
					   			Facilitating the closing process as well as providing legal support
					   		</li>
					   		<li>
					   			Interacting with your lawyer, financial advisor, or secretary, or anyone else you require to be a part of the process
					   		</li>
					   	</ul>
					   	<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>We make it quick and efficient</strong> – connecting medical professionals with SFR property opportunities and managing those investments is what we do, enabling you to gain the confidence knowing that your investment resources will be properly engaged
						<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>We do the day-to-day management</strong> – we make sure all maintenance and repairs are performed in a timely and efficient manner, ensuring your tenants are taken care of, contractors are vetted and that their fees are reasonable  and correct, and that your investment is kept in proper shape
						<br><br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>You gain the advantages without the disadvantages of being a landlord</strong> – we handle the taxes, insurance, any HOA fees, and do all the paperwork; we also check tenants’ backgrounds, process leases, and maximize occupancy and cash flow
