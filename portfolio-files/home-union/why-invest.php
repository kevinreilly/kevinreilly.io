				<p><strong>Enjoy diversification</strong> – investing a portion of your income outside of the stock market, or other financial vehicles, offers you greater financial protection</p>
				<p><strong>Increase your rate of appreciation</strong> – investing in real estate has, over the past 30 years, produced higher returns than stocks, bonds, REITs, and gold*</p>
				<p><strong>Leverage for greater cash flow</strong> – using loans to purchase multiple SFR properties enables you to leverage your investment, increasing cash flow as well as providing you with greater returns due to market appreciation and increases in rents</p>   
				<p><strong>Hedge against inflation</strong> – protecting yourself from inflation is a major advantage of investing in SFRs, since during periods of inflation rents go up while your mortgage remains fixed</p>
				<p><strong>Gain tax advantages</strong> – investing in SFRs provides numerous tax benefits, including the opportunity to use a Limited Liability Corporation to pay taxes as an individual, deduct mortgage interest, and prevent double taxation </p>
				<p><strong>Avoid volatility</strong> – owning HomeUnion MD-vetted SFRs enables you to invest in a rental market in which there is always demand</p>

						<p>Over the past 30 years, single-family residences (SFRs) have offered consistent returns while providing investors numerous tax benefits that are unavailable in other asset classes. Average annual pre-tax returns of 8.4 percent, and after-tax returns of 6.7 percent, best both bonds and gold. Furthermore, SFRs can be acquired with leverage, enabling investors to amplify the returns over time, an avenue unavailable in the equity markets. Like all investments, timing and selection can dramatically sway returns in the short term.</p>
